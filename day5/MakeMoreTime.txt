I lived my life wrong, and I don't want this happen to you
if you listen and take evasive action
I can help you change your future
The following few moments may very well change your life
and I wish some told me when I was your age
Money is not evil by itself
its just paper with perceived value
to obtain other things we value in other ways
If not money
what is evil you may ask
Evil is an uncontrollable obsessive and moral banding desire for more
evil is a bottomless soulless and obsessive compulsive pursue
of some part of goal at the end of some rainbow which doesn't exist
evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul
in exchange for financial success at any cost
evil is trying to buy happiness again and again
until all of those fake short living mirages or emotions are gone
Imagine having it all
only to lose it all
and you were now broken
all the money is gone
what do you have
the only solution to your madness and happiness is acquiring more
now you have no more mean to acquire fake happiness
no more means to acquire more
so who are you now?
we're all the people now
or you thought we're all friends
while the money was flowing in
you might have lost your family friends
and mostly everyone in the world
thinks you are a self-centered egotistied asshole
Why? because of your endless pursue for more
clouded your mind and diverted you from your true purpose in life
I'm not saying you can't be financially successful
I'm saying have a greater purpose in life
well beyond pursuit of financial success
does this hit an emotional chord in you
does it depress or frighten you
you soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
you can change it if you redefine what success is to you
You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
You can forgive yourself
and others who've hurt you
you can become an leader by mentoring with others
who you'd aspire to be like
can rebalance your priorities in life
you can heal your marriage
and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
You can become the best parent possible at any age even at 86
but don't wait until then
You'll always make more money but you can't make more time.
One day,just like me,you'll die too
what do you want to be remembered for
what can you do for others to make the world a better place
what is your true purpose on this earth
We are all dying
but only a small selected few are true living
You can step out of the shadows into the lights
you are meant for greatness
you are meant for more than just what you do for a living
you are an eternal being
meant to inspire and help the world
Lets get it right once and for all in this life time
just love more and more
everyday in every way
and never give up
regardless of how challenging your destiny in life will be
the world really needs you now more than ever
Together we love, compassion, forgiveness and faith in humanity
we will defeat evil once and for all

if you say that getting the money is the most important thing
you'll spend your life completely wasting your time
