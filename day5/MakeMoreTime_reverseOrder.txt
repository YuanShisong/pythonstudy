u'll spend ur life completely wasting ur time
if u say that getting the money is the most important thing
we will defeat evil once and for all
together we love,compassion,forvigeness and faith in humanity
the world really needs u now more than ever
regardless of how challenging ur destiny in life will be
and never give up
everyday in every way
just love more and more
lets get it right once and for all in this life time
meant to inspire and help the world
ur an eternal being
ur meant for more than just what u do for a living
you are meant for greatness
you can step out of the shadows into the lights
but only a small of us lived through a true living(@#$!@)
we are all dying
what is ur true purpose on this earth
what can you do for others to make this world a better place
what do you want to be remembered for
one day,just like me,you'll die too
but don't wait untill then
parent
You can become the best parrent possible at any age
and recreate a stronger love than u ever thoght possible
you can heal ur marrage
can rebalance ur priorities in life
who you'd aspire to be like
you can become an leader by mentoring with others
and others who've hurt you
You can forgive yourself
You can transform ur damaged relationships and build new ones
you can change it if you redefine what success is to you
you soul is screaming for u to answer ur true calling
did it depress or frighten you
does this hid an emotional chord in you
well beyound pursuit of financial success
i'm saying have a greater purpose in life
i'm not saying u can't be financially successful
from ur true purpose in life
clouded ur mind and diverted you
because of ur endless pursue for more
thinks u are a self-centered egotistical A-hole
and mostly everyone in the world
you might have lost ur family firends
while the money was flowing in
or u thought we're all friends(依旧听不清)
we're all the people now(听不清啊)
so who are you now?
no more means to acquire more
means↑
now u have no more mean to acquire forgiveness
is acquring more
is requiring more
the onlu solution to ur madness and happiness
what do u have
all the money is gone
and you were now borke
only to lose it all
Imagine having it all
mirages or emotions are gone
until all of those fake shortliving
evil is tring to buy happiness again and again
at any cost
in exchange for financial success
evil is having a price tagged for ur heart and soul
some rainbow which doesn't exist
of some part of goal at the end of
compulsive pursue
evil is a bottomless soulless and obsessive
evil is a bottomless soulless and compulsive
evil is an uncontrollable obsessive and moral banding desire
what is evil you may ask
if not money
to obtain other things we value in other ways
its just paper with pereived value
money is not evil by itself
and i wish some told me when i was ur age
the following few moments may very well change ur life
i can help u change ur future
if u listen and take evasive action
i live my life wrong,and i don't want this happen to you
